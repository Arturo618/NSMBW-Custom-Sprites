# Path Controller v1.0.0
*by Nin0, slightly edited by Synel*

*Original code can be found here: https://github.com/N-I-N-0/New-Super-Mario-Lost-Worlds*

## Kamek
- Add `src/path.h` in your `src` folder

*PS: You won't be able tell if it'll work before having a sprite that uses it.*

If there is a compilation or a game problem, tell me, maybe I forgot something somewhere.
